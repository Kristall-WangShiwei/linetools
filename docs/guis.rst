Overview
========

There are several GUIs included with linetools, primarily for
simple spectral inspection and analysis.

We caution that it is difficult (essentially impossible) to
generate unit tests for these GUIs.  As such, they are far
from bug free and may crash unexpectedly.  Buyer beware!

XSpecGUI
========

This GUI allows for a visual inspection of a spectrum.
Simple analysis (e.g. EW measurements) may also be performed.
See the Notebook for details.
