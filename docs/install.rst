Installing linetools
****************


Source Code
===========

linetools is available on github: <https://github.com/linetools/linetools>

Standard installation should be as simple as::

    git clone https://github.com/linetools/linetools.git
    python setup.py install

Dependencies
============

You will need to have installed both `astropy <http://www.astropy.org>` and `specutils <https://github.com/astropy/specutils>`.  
We generally recommend that you use Anaconda for installation, although
there are occasions where its distribution is somewhat out-of-date or (worse)
has bugs due to new/old versions of numpy, scipy, etc.
